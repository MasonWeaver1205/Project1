# Smart Mirror Design

Design
The mirror I have designed is one you are most likely to find in an apartment or home bathroom that many people like myself have.
I really enjoy designes that use vertical symmetry as well as appropriate spacing which is why I chose this design.
It also looks very sleek and even a bit futuristic which was what I was going for since it is supposed to be a smart mirror.

Implementation.
The first thing you must know with this mirror is that it is voice activated.
You must say Magic Mirror on the wall and the mirror will appear out of thin air in perfect working condition.
This feature took a long time to implement but I am very happy with how it turned out. 
My mirror also features a functional News app that takes a json file and reads the data to give you the news.
A similar app that allow the user to see upcoming events on thier calendar.
A health app which shows a graph containing a lot of health information including how much quality sleep the user is getting.
It also has a completely functional clock and the ability to backtrack by simply clicking on any app a second time to exit.

My Most advanced feature is the voice command neccesary to turn make the mirror appear. It was quite complicated to get the voice commands working and then I had to rework many different aspects of my design to get everything functioning properly again.
The saying is MAGIC MIRROR ON THE WALL
