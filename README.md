Current Design Issues
1. The Layout of the floor buttons does not match between the system and the real world.
2. The buttons do provide a small amount of feedback when the button is pressed revealing a fine white light around the button.
   However it is very difficult to see and provides no other feedback that the button has been pressed. 
3. The Elevator does not inform the user to the direction the elevator is currently going or the floor it is approaching next. This provides no visibility of System Status for the User.
