Current Design Issues
1. The Layout of the floor buttons does not match between the system and the real world.
2. The buttons do provide a small amount of feedback when the button is pressed revealing a fine white light around the button.
   However it is very difficult to see and provides no other feedback that the button has been pressed. 
3. The Elevator does not inform the user to the direction the elevator is currently going or the floor it is approaching next. This provides no visibility of System Status for the User.
4. All of the buttons on this elevator are very compact and it makes it hard for users to see the buttons they want.
5. There is very little audio feedback on this elevator. The elevator only makes a dinging sound when it has reached a floor and offers no more information.
6. The places where staff can insert keys on this elevator look like buttons themselves and are way too close to the buttons which can cause confusion.There is also an extra black button that serves no purpose when selected.
7. Some button labels are centered while others are not.

Overall the user interface on this elevator isnt terrible. There are no incredibly big design flaws but there are many smaller design issues that can easily be improved and provide an overall better experience for the user.
